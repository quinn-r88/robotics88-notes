> > Wildland fires in Canada burn an average of2.8 million hectares of forest annually. In years of extreme forest fire activity. total carbon emissions from wildland fires approach levels similar to industrial carbon emissions.
> 
> Canadian carbon from forest fires is comparable to Canadian carbon from all local industry.

> >  To capture spatial and temporal variability. the Boreal Fire Effects (BORFIRE) model estimates carbon emissions using detailed fuel and weather data. 
> 
> BORFIRE consumes weather and fuel data and estimates how much fuel will be burned.
