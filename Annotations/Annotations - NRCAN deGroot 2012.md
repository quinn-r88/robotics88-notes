> > Inputs to the model are based on the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System and fuel data. FWI parameters include the Drought Code (DC) and the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), the Buildup Index (BUI), and the Initial Spread Index (ISI). The DC is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers, while the FFMC represents the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels and is an indicator of its ease of ignition and flammability.The BUI is a numeric rating of the total amount of fuel available for combustion, and the ISI is an indicator of rate
